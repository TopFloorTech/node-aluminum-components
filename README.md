Aluminum Components
==========

A set of reusable web components (JS, SCSS mixins and styles, and template examples) for quickly building custom themes
and web applications.

## Installation

    npm install aluminum-components --save

## Usage

Full documentation is coming. In the meantime, the easiest way to get started is using Eyeglass.

If using Eyeglass, you can include the default set of Aluminum Components

    @import "aluminum-components/base"

If using with Drupal, you may wish to include the base set of default Drupal components as well:

    @import "aluminum-components/drupal"

## Contributing

All help is appreciated, especially in the form of bug reports and pull requests.
